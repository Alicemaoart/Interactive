  <h1>Seafoam girl</h1>
  
  <h3>1. Unlikely Meeting</h3>

  <p> <pre> 
A ghost stands before me,
Hair wet from a shower, dripping onto the beige carpet
too small in a free t-shirt that hangs like a rectangle
We sit side by side on twin beds, and I pretend 
not to notice how sometimes her hands go through the sheets. 

I had found her in the trunk of a car, the wrong car, a car that looked just like mine
zip ties around her arms and tape and blood caked over her mouth
Like a bad movie, except I was in it this time, 
In that empty parking lot in nowhere town. 

It’s a lonely life on these plains, these woods, this road, 
I am on a lonely trip in this private island of a little blue car
The blur outside of the windows might as well be a rolling scenery set
I might as well be driving on a treadmill to hell. 

The city was empty too,
the type of isolation only possible by sheer noise. 
Stuck in that stage of not-quite child, shooed out the door into adulthood. 
Short breaks taken with a cigarette, 
Long breaks taken with alcohol, a silhouette
Orphaned, in the way that all adults are. 

She said, take me to the ocean. 
I said, okay.
She said really?
I said I was going there anyway. 
This is technically not a lie. 
Two girls, no, a woman and a ghost on a road-trip —
Have you heard this one before? 
  </pre> </p>

<h3>2. Companion</h3>

  <p> <pre> 
I never expected a ghost to talk so much. You talk about the rain, the scattered light,
the roadside buildings shaped like hotdogs. You make me stop 
in strange little towns, dead silver mines and populations of fifty,
tourist traps and themed motels. 
You prop both feet on the dashboard, paint your nails a cherry red, 
put on lipstick and buy a man’s fedora. 
You tell me that you used to want to be president, then an astronaut, then a vast cloud.
You tell me you hate saying goodbyes, the ritual of it all. 
You tell me your name is Jessica, no, Elaine, no, Geoffrey, no, Jessie. 
Haha, just kidding, you said, I don’t remember. 
You tell me that you do not believe in ghosts. 
I want to ask, but I don’t. 

Tonight I had a dream about my mother, 
and how before she was my mother, she was a girl just like me or you. 

Sun-drenched translucency, my ghost best friend, I am afraid
You will leave, leaving crumpled shirt and borrowed underwear
If I dare to be happy. 
If I can barely trust the flesh and blood and alive to stay by my side,
How can I want stability from the half-gone? 

Most realistically:
This will all end when we reach the coastline
when I find a therapist, when I stop leaning into touch
When I am better, you will melt back into the seafoam.
And I’m getting better, we’re all getting better. 
  </pre> </p>

  <h3>3. Prayer</h3>

  <p> <pre> 
Jessica no Elaine no Geoffrey no Jessie,
I begin to think that you are a last wish. Mine or yours, I do not know. 
Did God know that I thought of this trip as a last pilgrimage? 
Did She know that every scenic bridge is a potential ending point for this story? 
That when I drove along mountainsides, I dream of wrenching my wheel left
And when I stand by bodies of water, I wish I could melt to seafoam too?
Or maybe cut the theatrics, I can just pull off the highway at three AM
Into a Walmart parking lot under the stars, blinded by floodlight
I can go to sleep and not wake up, exhaust turned inwards. 

Tonight I had a dream about God, 
and how before it all, She was a girl just like me or you. 
You are talking still, eating gas station gummy worms like a real girl, telling me your theory 
on love and life and small town society, the most important things in the world. 
you spend forty minutes detailing the coffee shop near your high school
And I start to think, shit, what happened between then and now? 
I want to ask, but this moment seems fragile. 

We do not bring up the circumstances that we met in. 
In fact, I barely remember what had happened 
between opening that trunk to you coming out of the motel shower. 
If this was a movie, you would smash cut from us first making eye contact
To you sitting under lukewarm water. 
If this was a poem– Well, who the hell would write a poem about this? 
  </pre> </p>

  <h3>4. Nadir</h3>

  <p> <pre> 
After you leave, I lock myself in the car and set it on fire. 
It’s not as difficult as you think, all of those magazines 
the ones you bought at the self-checkout, are quite flammable.  
I watch the plastic-coated pages melt and burn in sick fascination, 
And your nail polish’s plastic black cap melts into a brown bubbling pile. 
I was hoping, praying
for the car to explode, 
for some piece of the machinery or scrap metal to slice through 
my neck, stomach, heart. 

In the end, I gave up. The fire had licked too hot to my legs 
and I couldn't forget about you, it was like your will to live overrode my will to die
as I reached over the flames to take my wallet out of the glovebox, 
I smashed the glass, climbed out of the window, booked a flight back to the city.  

In the three hour layover I slumber in Denver, singed pant legs and cut palms, 
shrouded in my loss. 
Maybe you were a lesson after all, a lesson in humanity from the dead. 
And maybe you were successful. Among the remains of my old car, 
I found a will to live, didn’t I? 
  </pre> </p>

   <h3>5. U-turn</h3>

  <p> <pre> 
I met God when I returned to the city. 
She, in the shape of my mother, is sitting politely 
on my ragged, sagging sofa, patiently waiting. 
I opened the door, question heavy on my tongue, 
but she plucked it out of my head instead.

She answered, 
“Why must there be a reason?”
A pause.
“For all of it, for any of it? You pulled your own body 
out of that burning car, didn’t you?”
